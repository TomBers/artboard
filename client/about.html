		<h1>Collaborative Visualisation with Meteor and D3</h1><br>
		<p>
			I have been very interested in the possibilities of building tools that allow easy collaboration.  I have been working for some time with 2 technologies which make this a great deal easier (1, 2).  This site is an experiment in tying the idea of 'live' data with the visualisation possibilities HTML5.  <br><br>A shared canvas that anyone connected, no matter where they are in the world, is able to <i>paint</i> onto together with others around the world.<br><br>
			When developing the idea I was interested in 3 things :
			<ul><li>Simple user interface design.</li>
				<li>Restraining users options.</li>
				<li>Visual collaboration.</li></ul>
				<p>There are a number of routes where this project can go, but a demonstration of what can be achieved.

					<li>Meteor is a framework (based on NodeJs) that aims to reduce the pain involved in writing realtime web applications.  <br>One feature that makes it particularly interesting, is that it make it very easy to keep data synchronised between the server and clients. <a href="http://meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor</a></li>
					<li>D3 is a tool kit for manipulating websites based on data. It combines visualisation,animation and data-driven DOM manipulation. <a href="http://d3js.org" target="_blank">D3</a></li>
